## Description

Detecting objects using Tensorflow on <b>Opencv DNN module</b>.

## Model

The <b>ssd_mobilenet_coco</b> model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) network intended to perform object detection. The model has been trained from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) image dataset.Here I use ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.If you want to use other version of SSD Mobilenet ,you can find them in this [repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md#mobile-models).
